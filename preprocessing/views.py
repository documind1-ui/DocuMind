TEAM EXPORT: Django Views for Modules 4, 5, and 6
================================================================================
This file demonstrates how the Preprocessing, extraction, chunking, and FAISS
storage (Modules 4, 5, 6) are integrated into a Django view pipeline.

Your team can use this as a reference for handling the file parsing and vector
storage after the user uploads it. To use this code, ensure you have imported 
the utility logic we provided in `team_export_modules_4_to_6.py`.
